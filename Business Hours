# Business Hours

The feature turns on omnichannel toggle for the set business hours automatically and you will be able to receive omnichannel conversations. The toggle will be turned off during off hours. The enterprise workspaces have an option to setup multiple business hours according to different time zones and their business needs. Community workspaces can only setup one set of business hours.
